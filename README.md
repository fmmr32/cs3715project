project description : 

We will continue the implementation of our EduApp site.

You will be writing and running your own server.

The application will be based on the last EduApp version from the assignments.

The structure and layout of your site will undergo only small changes
There will be different students who can enrol in (and drop) classes (hard code about 10 members)
Additionally on a new page, students will be able to ask for (driving/walking) directions to each of the campuses. The directions will be calculated based on the current location of the student.
For persistence you can simply use JSON files (or MongoDB if you prefer). As template engine I suggest hogan.js. You must implement sending, storing and retrieving of events and course data (on the server - not local storage anymore). The web application is targeted primarily to mobile device users.

Our development environment is Eclipse. You will be using a git repository (hosted on GitHub) to synchronize your work (directly from Eclipse).
